The **destructive swap test** is a variant of the traditional swap test used in quantum computing to measure the similarity 
(overlap) between two quantum states. Unlike the standard swap test, it does not require an auxiliary qubit and uses fewer 
quantum gates, which reduces the noise in the system. The destructive swap test performs a series of measurements on all 
the qubits involved, destroying the superposition in the process, hence the term "destructive."
This test is especially useful for improving performance on noisy quantum devices, such as Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum 
(NISQ) processors, where gate noise can degrade the accuracy of computations.
